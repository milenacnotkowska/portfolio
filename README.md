I have taken six-month training in software testing from a reputed institute (Software Development Academy). I have learnt functional and non-functional testing. I have executed a project in software testing where I used automation testing tool Selenium to automate some of the commonly used features of the application. I have written test cases for the manual execution and reported defects in Jira. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills.
